You have reached the homepage of David J. Hendry. I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Methodology](https://www.lse.ac.uk/methodology) at the [London School of Economics and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/). I received my Ph.D. from the [Department of Political Science](https://pol.illinois.edu/) at the [University of Illinois](https://illinois.edu/). Previously, I was a postdoc at [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu/), where I was affiliated with the [Center for the Study of American Politics](https://csap.yale.edu/) in the [Institution for Social and Policy Studies](https://isps.yale.edu/), and an assistant professor at [Aarhus University](https://international.au.dk/), where I was affiliated with the [Department of Political Science](https://ps.au.dk/en/), the [Politics and Evolution Lab](https://ps.au.dk/en/research/research-projects/pone/), and the [Interacting Minds Centre](https://interactingminds.au.dk/). My research is primarily motivated by a desire to understand how social interactions lead to broad social and political changes, employing theoretical perspectives from social and evolutionary psychology, among others. I examine questions concerning racial and ethnic politics, political communication, cultural evolution, social network theory, and statistical methodology, to name a few. My substantive research employs a variety of methodological approaches, combining laboratory, field, and survey experiments, as well as observational and historical studies and computational simulations. In my methodological research, I focus primarily on event history methods.

Here you will find links to my research and teaching pages, as well as my curriculum vitae.
